# Your mission here is to transform a string following the CSV format to a 2d array.
# Your function will takes two arguments, the content of a CSV as a string and a separator.
# Your function will return an array (lines) of arrays (columns).
# In this assignement, you will have to solve a problem: how to transform a string into an array of array.

# When youâ€™re looking for things like (normally invisible) newline characters,
# or you want to make sure some value is correct, then you use p.
